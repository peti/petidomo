2001-02-17  Peter Simons <simons@computer.org>

	* Updated the documentation for the new version.

	* When posting to a list, Petidomo will now let the "Keywords:"
	and "Summary:" headers pass. These headers are uncommon but have
	been around for ages.

	* Petidomo will not log to syslog() with level LOG_NOTICE anymore
	unless it is an error or at least an unusual condition. Lowered
	level of most messages to LOG_INFO or below.

	* Fixed a type in the example master config file: MTAOptions
	should have '-i' set, not '-v'.

2001-01-21  Ralf S. Engelschall <rse@engelschall.com>

	* Added DESTDIR support to the Makefile.

	* Added "dump" mode to Petidomo, which is used by the
	petidomo-kickout script rather than messing in the config files
	itself.

2001-01-20  Ralf S. Engelschall <rse@engelschall.com>

	* Changed Petidomo so that it will send a separate mail to the
	list owner when someone subscribes, rather than just sending a
	carbon copy of the mail the user receives. This will prevent
	unnecessary confusion.

2001-01-20  Ralf S. Engelschall <rse@engelschall.com>

	* Added "dist" and "snap" target to the Makefile. These can be
	used to build a distribution or a snapshot respectively.

	* Added make targets for increasing or updating version
	information the version information: "update-version" will update
	the date but keep version number, "new-version" will let you
	interactively specify new version number. To specify the new
	version number for "new-version" on the command line, provide
	"VERSION=0.8.15".

2001-01-20  Peter Simons <simons@computer.org>

	* Underscores in file names suck, because you need an extra
	key-press to type them compared to the hyphen. For this reason
	(and for consistency) I corrected this horrible, horrible mistake
	of the past and renamed everything that contained an underscore.

2001-01-20  Peter Simons <simons@computer.org>

	* Renamed the MTA_Options" tag in the master config file to
	"MTAOptions" for consistency.

2001-01-19  Peter Simons <simons@computer.org>

	* Changed ACL semantics: The ACL is processed _only_ if the
	posting didn't have a valid password. If it did, the mail is going
	through in any case and the ACL is not processed.

	* Added a warning message to be logged when no global ACL file exists.

2001-01-19  Peter Simons <simons@computer.org>

	* Greatly enhanced the log messages Petidomo writes. Made the
	existing messages more helpful, added lots of new ones, generally
	made things real perfect. Remember: Life is BEAUTIFUL.

	* Added a message that is logged every time Petidomo starts up.
	This message will "dump" the configuration of Petidomo so that the
	user has a clue which Petidomo instance is doing what.

	* When a un-/subscribe command needs confirmation, the request for
	confirmation is sent to the address that is supposed to be added
	to or to be removed from the list. If, and only if, this address
	is different from the one the request came from, a short mail is
	sent to the requestor to inform him what is going on.

	* Mailing list config files may now have the suffix ".config" or
	".conf". Similarly, if the list config file is in a separate
	directory, it may be called <listname>/config or <listname>/conf.

	* Added code that will set the real user id of the process equal
	to the effective user id. Makes life easier for people who use
	Petidomo as a setuid binary.

2001-01-18  Ralf S. Engelschall <rse@engelschall.com>

	* Added two useful scripts for list administrators:
	petidomo-approve and petidomo-kickout.

2001-01-16  Peter Simons <simons@computer.org>

	* Added the "acknowledge" feature for mailing list postings.

	* Added new action keyword to the Access Control Language:
	"approve". This keyword will -- unlike "pass" -- not only pass the
	mail, but will also make sure that the mail passes all other
	authorization controls. This means, the mail will be treated as if
	the Petidomo master password had been provided.

	* The ACL is now tested _before_ anything else, meaning that you
	can use the "approve" action to bypass all other tests.

2001-01-15  Peter Simons <simons@computer.org>

	* The "ListType" keyword is no longer a mandatory directive in the
	list's config file; it now defaults to "open".

	* List config's "AllowPublicSubscripiton" does not exist anymore.
	Now we have "SubscriptionType" with valid values "public", "admin"
	or "acknowledged".

	* Added "AckQueueDirectory" directive to the master config file.

	* Removed the whole concept of "alien subscription". It was stupid
	to begin with and now that we'll have acknowledged subscriptions,
	it is useless, too.

	* Added "acknowledge" feature for un-/subscription requests.

	* Added --approved command line parameter, which is treated as a
	boolean. Whether it is set or not will be passed through to
	listserv_main() and to hermes_main(). The parameter will be used
	by the "acknowledge" mechanism.

2001-01-11  Peter Simons <simons@computer.org>

	* Added config entry "AcknowledgementFile" to the mailing list's
	config file.

	* The requestor will now receive a mail telling him something went
	wrong when he tries to un-/subscribe an address without specifying
	a (valid) list name.

2001-01-08  Peter Simons <simons@computer.org>

	* Added "install-testlist" target to the Makefile.

	* Rewrote Petidomo so that virtually any file's path can be
	configured at run-time now. The directives we suppert in the
	master config file are "ListDirectory", "HelpFile", "ACLFile", and
	"IndexFile". The ones in the list's config file are
	"IntroductionFile", "DescriptionFile", "ACLFile", "HeaderFile",
	"SignatureFile", and "AddressFile".

	* Added "install" target to the Makefile.

2001-01-06  Peter Simons <simons@computer.org>

	* The whole concept of the "petidomo" user is gone. Instead,
	compile complete paths into the binary and make them run-time
	configurable.

	* Added a "Petidomo:" prefix to all subject lines, to distinguish
	mail sent by Petidomo from regular mail. Rejection mails
	furthermore have the prefix "BOUNCE <listaddress>:", mails that
	need approval have the prefix "APPROVE <listaddress>:".

	* When a mail is rejected due to ACL, the mail body will tell you
	whether the global acl file or the list's local acl file hit.

	* If a file "lists/<listname>/header" exists, it contents will be
	added to the headers of the article posted to the list. Be careful
	not to have blank lines in there, as this will screw the whole
	message up.

	* The result of the INDEX command is no longer generated on the
	fly. Instead, the contents of a file is send back, which the
	administrator can edit as he wishes -- very much like the HELP
	file thing Petidomo had for ever. Consequently, the "ShowOnIndex"
	directive in the list's config file is gone.

2000-12-15  Peter Simons <simons@computer.org>

	* The whole signature stuff the commercial Petidomo is gone; the
	free version does not need this. This, the "AppendSignature"
	directive in the list's config file is gone.

	* Removed options "DetachImmediately" and "ShowStatistics" options
	from the master config file. These were never used anyway.

	* Removed the mail rescue mechanism and all relating code. I guess
	_nobody_ ever used that mechanism anyway, not even me. :-)

	* Petidomo no longer cares under what name it has been started.
	The different modes of operation will now be distinguished by the
	mandatory command line parameter "--mode".

2000-12-14  Peter Simons <simons@computer.org>

	* Removed the complimentary mail2news.c program from the
	distribution. The program isn't tested, it isn't documented ... so
	away with it.

2000-12-01  Ralf S. Engelschall <rse@engelschall.com>

	* Added Perl scripts petidomo-approve and petidomo-kickout which
	are useful to reduce the amount of effort required in daily
	mailing lists administration.

2000-12-01  Peter Simons <simons@computer.org>

	* CyberSolutions GmbH has released a version of Petidomo 2.2 under
	GPL at <http://www.petidomo.com/download/OpenPetidomo/source/>.
	Now that Petidomo is available under a free license again, I
	imported these sources and started working it. The free version
	will be released as part of the Open Structured Server Platform
	(OSSP) project. Financing has kindly been provided by the Cable
	and Wireless Corporation.

1999-11-15  Peter Simons  <simons@petidomo.com>

	* Petidomo has been sold to CyberSolutions GmbH, Germany. All work
	on it stops here. They will release a new version (Petidomo III)
	as a commercial product. The free branch of the program is dead.

1998-08-20  Peter Simons  <simons@petidomo.com>

	* Released as Petidomo 2.2.

	* Fixed a few problems in the binary install script.

	* Added rfc2369.sh posting filter to the distribution.

1998-08-17  Peter Simons  <simons@petidomo.com>

	* Released as Petidomo 2.2 beta 2.

	* You can create binary distributions simply by executing "make
 	build-bin-dist". All users are encouraged to share binaries for
 	platforms we can not support.

	* Petidomo compiles now on SunOS 4.x.

	* Added a -real- RFC 822 parser. This will fix all problems with
	the more obscure forms of e-mail syntax.

	* Added ShowStatistics (bool) keyword to the master config file.
 	(Only in the commercial version.) This switch allows the
 	administrator to switch the signature off, listserv appends when
 	replying a request. The switch is also supported in the CGI
 	configuration manager.

	* Added nice run time statistics to be appended as signature every
 	time listserv processes an incoming mail.

	* Fixed a security hole in the CGI configuration manager, that
	could be abused to delete arbitrary mailing lists on a server.

	* Added a stand-alone implementation of the regular expression
 	library which will be used in favor of the one provided in the OS,
 	if --with-my-regex is specified at configure. This is necessary on
 	some Solaris versions.

1998-01-27  Peter Simons  <simons@petidomo.com>

	* Released as Petidomo 2.1, finally. (Phew!)

	* Documented that "sendmail -bv" can be used to verify addresses,
 	in the "misc" chapter of the user manual.

	* Added pgp-(encrypt|decrypt).sh scripts to the distribution and
	documented their usage in the manual. With them, Petidomo is able
	to handle fully encrypted mailing lists.

	* Fixed a problem in the code that called sendmail for the
 	delivery that would cause the exec() call to fail for large lists
 	(>5000 addresses).

	* Petidomo will no longer accept list named that have special
 	characters of the file system in them, like '/' as this is a
 	security risk.

	* Both hermes and listserv will now set both their real- and
	effective user-id to "petidomo" at startup, to avoid permission
	problems on systems that restore the real user-id when calling
	external problems with exec().

	* etc/COPYRIGHT: Added copyright license, which is needed for the
	upcoming release of the sources.

	* Makefile: Added build-bin-dist target, which can be used to
	automatically compile a binary release archive.

	* Added --enable-dynamic-link option to configure script, to let
 	the user choose to link static binaries conveniently.

1998-01-04  Peter Simons  <simons@petidomo.com>

	* Released as 2.1 beta 5

	* Re-wrote the parser for the access control language completely.
	The new version uses lex/yacc for parsong and is way more robust
	and faster. It will also issue more detailed syntax errors, in
	case the acl file is incorrect. The new code also fixed a couple
	of weird problems on some platforms.

1997-12-21  Peter Simons  <simons@petidomo.com>

	* Released as 2.1 beta 4

	* When DEBUG is defined at compile time, loads of debugging output
	is added to all programs. Debugging can be activated with the -d
	switch on the command line. The syntax is "-d module,level", with
	level being an integer from 1 to 9, and module being one of the
	named as defined in include/debug.h in the sources.

	* Hermes will now preserve the "References:" field when posting an
 	article.

	* Fixed a bug in the filter code that could result in hermes
	hanging forever in a read() loop.

	* Quite a few internal changes that are probably not worth being
	listed here.

1997-06-30  Peter Simons  <simons@petidomo.com>

	* Released as Petidomo 2.0.

Petidomo v1
===========

	* There are no ChangeLog entries known for Petidomo v1.
