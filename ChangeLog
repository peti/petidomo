Petidomo v4
===========

2000-12-01  Peter Simons <simons@computer.org>

	* [...TO BE FILLED IN BY PETI...]

2000-12-01  Ralf S. Engelschall <rse@engelschall.com>

	* Included various cleanups and adjustments derived from the original
	OSSP hacks for Petidomo 2.2

	* Added Perl scripts petidomo-approve and petidomo-kickout which are
	useful to reduce the amount of effort required in daily mailing lists
	administration.

2000-12-01  Peter Simons <simons@computer.org>

	* The base of this work off is again the latest free
	version of Petidomo: 2.2, as released under GPLv2 on
	http://www.petidomo.com/download/OpenPetidomo/source/ by
	CyberSolutions GmbH.

Petidomo v3
===========

	* There are no ChangeLog entries available for Petidomo v3, but that
	doesn't matter because Petidomo v4 is based on the last version of
	Petidomo v2. Nevertheless the non-free Petidomo v3 provided mainly an
	optional user-interface and the ability to directly deliver mails in
	parallel via SMTP.

Petidomo v2
===========

1999-06-01  Peter Simons  <simons@petidomo.com>

	* Re-released under GNU GPL.

1998-08-20  Peter Simons  <simons@petidomo.com>

	* Released as Petidomo 2.2.

	* Fixed a few problems in the binary install script.

	* Added rfc2369.sh posting filter to the distribution.

1998-08-17  Peter Simons  <simons@petidomo.com>

	* Released as Petidomo 2.2 beta 2.

	* You can create binary distributions simply by executing "make
 	build-bin-dist". All users are encouraged to share binaries for
 	platforms we can not support.

	* Petidomo compiles now on SunOS 4.x.

	* Added a -real- RFC 822 parser. This will fix all problems with
	the more obscure forms of e-mail syntax.

	* Added ShowStatistics (bool) keyword to the master config file.
 	(Only in the commercial version.) This switch allows the
 	administrator to switch the signature off, listserv appends when
 	replying a request. The switch is also supported in the CGI
 	configuration manager.

	* Added nice run time statistics to be appended as signature every
 	time listserv processes an incoming mail.

	* Fixed a security hole in the CGI configuration manager, that
	could be abused to delete arbitrary mailing lists on a server.

	* Added a stand-alone implementation of the regular expression
 	library which will be used in favor of the one provided in the OS,
 	if --with-my-regex is specified at configure. This is necessary on
 	some Solaris versions.

1998-01-27  Peter Simons  <simons@petidomo.com>

	* Released as Petidomo 2.1, finally. (Phew!)

	* Documented that "sendmail -bv" can be used to verify addresses,
 	in the "misc" chapter of the user manual.

	* Added pgp-(encrypt|decrypt).sh scripts to the distribution and
	documented their usage in the manual. With them, Petidomo is able
	to handle fully encrypted mailing lists.

	* Fixed a problem in the code that called sendmail for the
 	delivery that would cause the exec() call to fail for large lists
 	(>5000 addresses).

	* Petidomo will no longer accept list named that have special
 	characters of the file system in them, like '/' as this is a
 	security risk.

	* Both hermes and listserv will now set both their real- and
	effective user-id to "petidomo" at startup, to avoid permission
	problems on systems that restore the real user-id when calling
	external problems with exec().

	* etc/COPYRIGHT: Added copyright license, which is needed for the
	upcoming release of the sources.

	* Makefile: Added build-bin-dist target, which can be used to
	automatically compile a binary release archive.

	* Added --enable-dynamic-link option to configure script, to let
 	the user choose to link static binaries conveniently.

1998-01-04  Peter Simons  <simons@petidomo.com>

	* Released as 2.1 beta 5

	* Re-wrote the parser for the access control language completely.
	The new version uses lex/yacc for parsong and is way more robust
	and faster. It will also issue more detailed syntax errors, in
	case the acl file is incorrect. The new code also fixed a couple
	of weird problems on some platforms.

1997-12-21  Peter Simons  <simons@petidomo.com>

	* Released as 2.1 beta 4

	* When DEBUG is defined at compile time, loads of debugging output
	is added to all programs. Debugging can be activated with the -d
	switch on the command line. The syntax is "-d module,level", with
	level being an integer from 1 to 9, and module being one of the
	named as defined in include/debug.h in the sources.

	* Hermes will now preserve the "References:" field when posting an
 	article.

	* Fixed a bug in the filter code that could result in hermes
	hanging forever in a read() loop.

	* Quite a few internal changes that are probably not worth being
	listed here.

1997-06-30  Peter Simons  <simons@petidomo.com>

	* Released as Petidomo 2.0.

Petidomo v1
===========

	* There are no ChangeLog entries known for Petidomo v1.
