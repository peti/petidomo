#  TAG: Hostname <string>
#	This entry specifies the fully qualified domain name, Petidomo
#	should use. This will usually be the 'real' name of the machine the
#	software is running on, for example:
#
#	Hostname listserver.foo.bar
#
#	The name of the machine and the used name need not necessarily be
#	the same, though. Please consult the manual for further details
#	about using this feature, looking at the chapter ``Virtual
#	Hosting''.
#
#	This option is REQUIRED. Petidomo will abort with an error, if it is
#	unset.
#Hostname	petidomo.example.org

#  TAG: AdminPassword <string>
#	This tag sets the master password, which authenticiates the
#	administrator of the package. Please chose this password carefully.
#	Knowledge of the master password will enable you to access ALL
#	mailing lists running on this system. Passwords are always
#	case-insensitive.
#
#	This option is REQUIRED. Petidomo will abort with an error, if it is
#	unset.
#AdminPassword	"open sesame"

#  TAG: MTA <string>
#	This entry tell Petidomo which mail transport agent should be used
#	to deliver outgoing emails. You should configure the full path of
#	the program to call here, like in the following example:
#
#	MTA "/usr/sbin/sendmail"
#
#	This option is REQUIRED. Petidomo will abort with an error, if it is
#	unset.
#MTA	"/usr/sbin/sendmail"

#  TAG: MTA_Options <string>
#	This entry sets the options which will be handed over to the MTA
#	when it is called. The following example
#
#	MTA_Options "-odq -v -f%s"
#
#	will yield a call "<mta> -odq -v -f<envelope>". The '%s' is
#	replaced with the envelope the mail should be sent under. If you
#	set this this option, be sure to include the '%s' tag or Petidomo
#	will terminate with an error, because it depends on setting the
#	envelope.
#
#	In 99% of all cases you won't need to set this option and should
#	leave it alone.
#
#	The default, if the option is unset, is the string '-f%s'.
#MTA_Options	"-i -f%s"

#  TAG: List_Directory <string>
#       This entry sets the path to the directory, where Petidomo will
#       expect the list config files to be. The whole thing works as
#       follows: When Petidomo tries to open a config file for the
#       mailing list "foo", it will look for
#       "<list_directory>/foo/config" first, then for
#       "<list_directory>/foo.config". If neither exists, it
#       terminates with an error.
#
#       The default List_Directory, assuming an installation prefix of
#       "/usr/local", is "/usr/local/var/petidomo".
#List_Directory /usr/local/var/petidomo

#  TAG: Help_File <string>
#	This entry sets the path to the help file Petidomo sends back
#	whenever it receives a HELP command or a mail containing no
#	valid commands at all. The default value, assuming an
#	installation prefix of "/usr/local", is
#	"/usr/local/share/petidomo/help".
#Help_File	/usr/local/share/petidomo/help

#  TAG: ACL_File <string>
#	This entry sets the path to the master ACL file used by
#	Petidomo. The default value, assuming an installation prefix
#	of "/usr/local", is "/usr/local/etc/petidomo.acl".
#ACL_File	/usr/local/etc/petidomo.acl

#  TAG: Index_File <string>
#	This entry sets the path to the index file Petidomo sends back
#       whenever it receives an INDEX command. The default value,
#       assuming an installation prefix	of "/usr/local", is
#       "/usr/local/var/petidomo/index".
#Index_File	/usr/local/var/petidomo/index
