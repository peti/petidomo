#  TAG: Hostname <string>
#       This entry specifies the fully qualified domain name, Petidomo
#       should use. This will usually be the 'real' name of the machine the
#       software is running on, for example:
#
#       Hostname listserver.foo.bar
#
#       The name of the machine and the used name need not necessarily be
#       the same, though. Please consult the manual for further details
#       about using this feature, looking at the chapter ``Virtual
#       Hosting''.
#
#       This option is REQUIRED. Petidomo will abort with an error, if it is
#       unset.
#Hostname       petidomo.example.org

#  TAG: AdminPassword <string>
#       This tag sets the master password, which authenticiates the
#       administrator of the package. Please chose this password carefully.
#       Knowledge of the master password will enable you to access ALL
#       mailing lists running on this system. Passwords are always
#       case-insensitive.
#
#       This option is REQUIRED. Petidomo will abort with an error, if it is
#       unset.
#AdminPassword  "open sesame"

#  TAG: MTA <string>
#       This entry tell Petidomo which mail transport agent should be used
#       to deliver outgoing emails. You should configure the full path of
#       the program to call here, like in the following example:
#
#       MTA "/usr/sbin/sendmail"
#
#       This option is REQUIRED. Petidomo will abort with an error, if it is
#       unset.
#MTA    "/usr/sbin/sendmail"

#  TAG: MTAOptions <string>
#       This entry sets the options which will be handed over to the MTA
#       when it is called. The following example
#
#       MTAOptions "-odq -i -f%s"
#
#       will yield a call "<mta> -odq -i -f<envelope>". The '%s' is
#       replaced with the envelope the mail should be sent under. If you
#       set this this option, be sure to include the '%s' tag or Petidomo
#       will terminate with an error, because it depends on setting the
#       envelope.
#
#       In 99% of all cases you won't need to set this option and should
#       leave it alone.
#
#       The default, if the option is unset, is '-i -f%s'.
#MTAOptions    "-i -f%s"

#  TAG: ListDirectory <string>
#       This entry sets the path to the directory, where Petidomo will
#       expect the list config files to be. The whole thing works as
#       follows: When Petidomo tries to open a config file for the
#       mailing list "foo", it will look for
#       "<list-directory>/foo/config" first, then for
#       "<list-directory>/foo.config". If neither exists, it
#       terminates with an error.
#
#       The default ListDirectory, assuming an installation prefix of
#       "/usr/local", is "/usr/local/var/petidomo/lists".
#ListDirectory	/usr/local/var/petidomo/lists

#  TAG: AckQueueDirectory <string>
#       This entry sets the path to the directory, where Petidomo will
#       queue requests and postings that need an acknowledgement in
#       order to be processed. The default directory, assuming an
#       installation prefix of "/usr/local", is
#       "/usr/local/var/petidomo/ack-queue".
#AckQueueDirectory /usr/local/var/petidomo/ack-queue

#  TAG: HelpFile <string>
#       This entry sets the path to the help file Petidomo sends back
#       whenever it receives a HELP command or a mail containing no
#       valid commands at all. The default value, assuming an
#       installation prefix of "/usr/local", is
#       "/usr/local/share/petidomo/help".
#HelpFile      /usr/local/share/petidomo/help

#  TAG: ACLFile <string>
#       This entry sets the path to the master ACL file used by
#       Petidomo. The default value, assuming an installation prefix
#       of "/usr/local", is "/usr/local/etc/petidomo.acl".
#ACLFile       /usr/local/etc/petidomo.acl

#  TAG: IndexFile <string>
#       This entry sets the path to the index file Petidomo sends back
#       whenever it receives an INDEX command. The default value,
#       assuming an installation prefix of "/usr/local", is
#       "/usr/local/var/petidomo/index".
#IndexFile     /usr/local/var/petidomo/index
