	      How to use the Petidomo 2.x mailing list server
	      ***********************************************

Petidomo is an automatic mailing list server, which maintains mailing lists
without any human interaction. The program understands a set of commands
which you can use to add yourself to mailing lists, or to remove you from
lists you are subscribed on. These commands will be explained in the
following paragraphs:

 SUBSCRIBE
	The "subscribe" command will add your address to a mailing list.
	Usually sending an e-mail to the server with only this word in the
	body of the mail will do the right thing for you. In case you want
	to subscribe an address not equal to the one you are mailing from,
	you can add this address as parameter to the command, like this:

	subscribe user@site.domain.net

	Please note that many list servers to do not allow to subscribe
	other addresses than your own, though, because this feature can be
	abused.

 UNSUBSCRIBE
	Syntax and usage of the "unsubscribe" command are the same as with
	the "subscribe" command, the purpose is a bit different though:
	Sending this command to the server will remove your address from
	the mailing list.

 INDEX
	The "index" command does not need any parameters. Sending it to the
	server will get you a list of available mailing lists on this
	server. This is useful in case you want to subscribe to a list but
	can't remember the exact name anymore.

 HELP
	The "help" command will make the list server send you this file.

 HELP listname
	If you specify a parameter after the "help" command, the server
	will send you the description of this mailing list back. The
	description usually contains the topic and purpose of the mailing
	list.

Commands must begin at the first column on each line in the mail, to
be recognized. Lines which do not contain a command will be ignored.
