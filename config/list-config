#  TAG: ListType <open|closed|moderated>
#       The following types of mailing lists exists and one of them
#       should be specified here:
#
#         open -- The list is open for all postings which are not rejected
#		due to the access control mechanism.
#         closed -- Only subscribers are allowed to post.
#         moderated -- Only postings which contain the correct posting
#		password are allowed.
#
#       This option is REQUIRED. Petidomo will abort with an error, if it is
#       unset.
ListType	open

#  TAG: AllowPublicSubscription <yes|no>
#	  yes -- Everybody can subscribe and unsubscribe.
#         no  -- Un-/subscription can only be done by the admin.
#		Authenticiation is done via password mechanism.
#
#	The default, if this option is unset, is to allow public
#	subscription and unsubscription.
AllowPublicSubscription	yes

#  TAG: AllowAlienSubscription <yes|no>
#	  yes -- Users are allowed to subscribe and unsubscribe addresses
#		not equal to the address they're sending the mail from.
#         no  -- Users can only add (or remove) the address they're sending
#		the mail from to the list (from the list).
#	This option has no effect if public subscription has been
#	disallowed.
#
#	The default, if this option is unset, is to allow alien
#	subscription and unsubscription.
AllowAlienSubscription	yes

#  TAG: AllowMembersCommand <yes|no>
#	Does the 'members' or 'who' command work for this mailing list, or
#	do you want to keep the addresses of the subscribers confidential?
#	Set this option to 'yes' to allow the 'members'-command, or set it
#	to 'no' to disallow it.
#
#       The default, if the option is unset, is NOT to allow the 'members'-
#	command.
AllowMembersCommand	no

#  TAG: Hostname <string>
#       This entry specifies the fully qualified domain name, Petidomo
#       should use. This will usually be the 'real' name of the machine the
#       software is running on, for example:
#
#       HostName listserver.foo.bar
#
#       The name of the machine and the used name need not necessarily be
#       the same, though. Please consult the manual for further details
#       about using this feature, looking at the chapter ``Virtual
#       Hosting''.
#
#       If this option is unset, Petidomo will use the name that has
#	been specified in the master config file, ~petidomo/etc/petidomo.conf.
#Hostname        host.domain.net

#  TAG: AdminPassword <string>
#       This tag sets the master password, which authenticiates the
#	administrator of this mailing list. The administrator has
#	special priviledes, such as deleting other users, overriding
#	access control restrictions or un-/subscribing users to closed
#	mailing lists. Passwords are always case-insensitive.
#
#       Leave this entry blank, if you don't want to enable remote
#	administration of the mailing list. This is not recommended,
#	though, because you will have to edit all files manually,
#	then.
#AdminPassword   "open sesame"

#  TAG: PostingPassword <string>
#	The posting password must be specified when posting to closed
#	or moderated mailing lists, or the server will reject the
#	article and forward it to the list owner. Passwords are always
#	case-insensitive.
#PostingPassword	"yeahyeah"

#  TAG: ReplyTo <address|none>
#	This tag controls the 'Reply-To:' field, which Petidomo adds
#	to posted articles before they are delivered. Using this
#	option, you can force Petidomo to insert a 'Reply-To:' which
#	points to a certain address, or you can tell Petidomo to leave
#	'Reply-To:' alone, by setting the parameter to "none".
#
#	If this option is unset, Petidomo will default to insert a
#	'Reply-To:' point back to the mailing list, so that
#	subscribers can conveniently post simply by hitting the
#	'reply' function in their mail reader.
#ReplyTo	none

#  TAG: PostingFilter <string>
#       If you specify a posting filter, this program or script will
#       be started by Petidomo right before it sends a posting out to
#       the subscribers. The programm will receive the article, as it
#       has been prepared by Petidomo on standard input and is expect
#       to write the final version to standard output. The posting
#       filter can be used to manipulate the headers for special
#       purposes, for example.
#
#	If the filter program exits with a returncode not equal to 0
#       (zero), Petidomo will not post the article and terminate.
#PostingFilter "/bin/cat"

#  TAG: Archive <string>
#	Petidomo has the ability to archive all articles that have been
#	posted to a mailing list. With this tag you can chose the path to
#	this archive. You have two options: You can specify a directory
#	name here, or a file name. If Petidomo finds a file name, it will
#	simply append the posted article to the file, one by one. If you
#	provide the path of a directory, Petidomo will save each article in
#	a seperate file into this directory. Paths without a leading slash
#	("/") are treated relative to the list's home directory, otherwise
#	the path is absolute.
#
#	If this option is unset, no archives of the posted articles will be
#	kept.
#Archive		"log"


#  TAG: IntroductionFile <string>
#	This entry sets the path to the introduction file, which
#	Petidomo will send to every new subscriber. If the path is not
#	absolute -- not beginning with a '/' character, that is --, it
#	will be interpreted relative to the directory where this
#	config file has been found.
#
#	If this option has not been set, the default value is
#	"introduction".
#IntroductionFile	introduction

#  TAG: DescriptionFile <string>
#	This entry sets the path to the description file, which
#	Petidomo will send back to a "help listname" command. If the

#	where this config file has been found.
#
#	If this option has not been set, the default value is
#	"description".
#DescriptionFile	description

#  TAG: ACLFile <string>
#	This entry sets the path to the ACL file, which Petidomo will
#	use to check whether a posting to this list is allowed. If the
#	path is not absolute -- not beginning with a '/' character,
#	that is --, it will be interpreted relative to the directory
#	where this config file has been found.
#
#	If this option has not been set, the default value is "acl".

#  TAG: HeaderFile <string>
#	This entry sets the path to the header file, which's contents
#	Petidomo will add to the header of every posting on this list.

#  TAG: AddressFile <string>
#	This entry sets the path to the address database file, which

#	to the directory where this config file has been found.
#
#	If this option has not been set, the default value is
#	"list".
#AddressFile	list

#  TAG: AcknowledgementFile <string>
#	This entry sets the path to the acknowledgement database file,
#	which Petidomo uses to store the addresses of posters who have
#	verified their address by acknowledgement already. If the path

#	this config file has been found.
