			  OSSP Petidomo 4.0

On December 12th, 2000, CyberSolutions GmbH published a version of
Petidomo 2.2 under the GNU General Public License. The OSSP project
enhanced that version significantly and hereby releases the result of
its efforts as »OSSP Petidomo 4.0«. OSSP Petidomo is a small but
powerful package that can be used to host and maintain mailing lists
on an Unix machine. Its only requirement is that there is a working
mail transport agent installed, such as sendmail.

OSSP Petidomo has -- among other things -- the following features:

 * A simple-to-use e-mail command interface, which can be used by
   users and administrators of a mailing list to subscribe or
   unsubscribe addresses, approve postings that have been deferred or
   rejected, list all subscribed addresses of a list, etc.

 * Petidomo supports various modes of operation for a mailing list
   such as open lists, closed lists, and moderated lists.

 * Mailing list subscriptions or postings can be verified by requiring
   an acknowledgement. This feature is particularly useful when used
   for mailing list postings as it will keep the vast majority of all
   spam mail off the list.

 * Petidomo can host an arbitrary number of mailing lists in entirely
   different domain name spaces -- also known as »Virtual Hosting«.

 * A powerful »Access Control Language« (ACL) can be used to reject,
   approve, drop, or redirect postings or subscription attempts.

 * Mailing list postings can be piped through an external »Posting
   Filter«, which can modify the article before it's delivered in any
   way it sees fit.

 * Petidomo can be configured to add arbitrary headers to any mail
   that's posted on a mailing list.

 * Petidomo can be configured to add a signature to any mail that's
   posted on a mailing list.

The whole package is written in ISO-C and should compile
out-of-the-box on any POSIX.1 compliant system that provides a mail
transport agent. It has been released under the GNU General Public
License.
